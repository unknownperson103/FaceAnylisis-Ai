Make the app like Lookmax AI with clean working, zero errors, and easy to use. User experience must be buttery smooth.


---

A. Mandatory Features to Include

1. Live Camera + Image Upload

2. One Click "LookMax Result" Button

Combines:

Face Shape

Symmetry Score

Golden Ratio

Hairstyle Suggestion


Gives single-screen result card

3. Hairstyle Try-On Feature (No API)

On-click hairstyle from below gallery applies directly to head

Overlay PNG images mapped to face landmarks

User sees:

Multi-language support (EN/Hindi)

Fully responsive (mobile/tablet)

Back buttons and transitions must not cause reload

All buttons must have hover + active effect

Dark mode optional but nice to have



---

C. Must-Have Fixes & Bug-Free Requirements

No crash on slow devices

If no face is detected, show user-friendly popup

Add retry and reset options

G. Summary Instruction for Developer

> “Please make sure each feature listed above is working without breaking current app logic, and no bugs/errors in camera, analysis, buttons, or overlays. Add one-click result, hairstyle try-on from bottom gallery, and make UI easy and smooth. Everything should feel like an app, not just a webpage.”
