   const [recommendations, setRecommendations] = useState<FaceRecommendation[]>([]);
   const [showLookMaxResult, setShowLookMaxResult] = useState(false);
   
   // Key functions:
   const generateLookMaxResult = () => {...} // Generates comprehensive report
   const saveAsImage = () => {...} // Saves result as image
   ```

3. **client/src/components/FeatureCard.tsx**
   - Display component for individual facial features
   ```typescript
   interface FeatureCardProps {
     feature: FaceFeatureAnalysis;
     className?: string;
     onClick?: () => void;
   }
   ```

4. **client/src/components/FaceScanOverlay.tsx**
   - Visual guide for face positioning during scan
   ```typescript
   export function FaceScanOverlay({ className }: { className?: string }) {
     // Render oval overlay with guides for proper face positioning
   }
   ```

#### Core Analysis Engine
1. **client/src/lib/face-analysis.ts**
   - Face detection implementation
   - Feature analysis algorithms
   - Scoring and recommendation generation
   ```typescript
   // Key functions:
   export async function detectFace(imageElement): Promise<FaceDetection | null> {...}
   export async function analyzeFace(imageData: string): Promise<FaceAnalysisData> {...}
   
   // Helper functions:
   function calculateFaceShape(landmarks): string {...}
   function calculateSymmetryScore(landmarks): number {...}
   function calculateGoldenRatio(landmarks): number {...}
   ```

#### Data Models
1. **shared/schema.ts**
   - Type definitions for analysis data
   - Interface declarations for features, ratings, recommendations
   ```typescript
   export interface FaceFeatureAnalysis {
     label: string;
     value: string;
   }
   
   export interface FaceRating {
     category: string;
     score: number;
     percentage: number;
   }
   
   export interface FaceRecommendation {
     id: number;
     title: string;
     description: string;
     icon: string;
     color: string;
   }
   
   export interface FaceAnalysisData {
     features: FaceFeatureAnalysis[];
     ratings: FaceRating[];
     recommendations: FaceRecommendation[];
   }
   ```

#### Backend Services
1. **server/routes.ts**
   - API endpoints for analysis data
   - Storage interface for user data
   ```typescript
   export async function registerRoutes(app: Express): Promise<Server> {
     // API endpoint setup for face analysis
     app.post('/api/analyze', async (req, res) => {...})
   }
   ```

2. **server/storage.ts**
   - Memory storage implementation for user data
   ```typescript
   export class MemStorage implements IStorage {
     // Methods for CRUD operations on user and analysis data
   }
   ```

### Implementation Notes

#### Face Detection Process
1. Uses face-api.js TinyFaceDetector for efficient detection
2. Loads models from static files (/models directory)
3. Implements timeout fallback to ensure usability even if detection fails
4. Provides visual feedback during detection process

#### Camera Implementation
1. Uses react-webcam with mirrored view for natural interaction
2. Sets appropriate video constraints for optimal resolution
3. Handles errors with fallback to file upload mode
4. Implements throttled face detection to avoid performance issues

#### Styling and UI
1. Clean, minimalist design with clear visual hierarchy
2. Interactive elements with appropriate hover/active states
3. Loading indicators for all processing steps
4. Responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop

## Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Hairstyle Try-On Feature
- Create component to overlay hairstyle PNGs on detected face
- Implement gallery of hairstyles categorized by face shape
- Add controls for adjusting size and position

### 2. Multi-Language Support
- Set up i18n framework
- Implement EN/Hindi language toggle
- Create translation files for all text content

### 3. Save as Image Functionality
- Implement canvas rendering of result card
- Add download functionality with proper formatting
- Support sharing to social media

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Optimize face detection for faster performance
- Implement caching for analysis results
- Add offline support for core functionalities

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Appropriate camera access permissions

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Start development server with `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the local development URL

### Environment Configuration
- No API keys required for core functionality
- Static models served from public/models directory

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
- Camera access denied: Ensure proper permissions and check for browser support
- Face detection issues: Adjust lighting for better results
- Performance concerns: Reduce video resolution on slower devices
